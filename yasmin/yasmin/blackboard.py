    """
    A thread-safe blackboard for storing key-value pairs.

    The Blackboard class provides a mechanism to store data in a dictionary-like format,
    allowing for concurrent access and modification through thread-safe operations.

    Attributes:
        _data (Dict[str, Any]): A dictionary holding the data stored in the blackboard.
        __lock (Lock): A threading lock to ensure thread-safe access to the _data attribute.

    Methods:
        __getitem__(key): Retrieve a value associated with the given key.
        __setitem__(key, value): Set a value for the given key.
        __delitem__(key): Remove the value associated with the given key.
        __contains__(key): Check if a key exists in the blackboard.
        __len__(): Return the number of items in the blackboard.
        __repr__(): Return a string representation of the blackboard's data.
